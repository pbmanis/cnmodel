# Synapse definitions for models.
#
# This file includes a number of different synapse definitions and default conductances
# for point models. Most are models from the lab for neurons of the cochlear nucleus.
# the synaptic receptor models are gleaned from the literature and sometimes fitted to the 
# cochlear nucleus data.

A Note About the Branches
=========================
There are 2 branches in this public repository for CNModel.

The "main" branch is the original branch that goes with Manis and Campagnola, Hear. Res. 2018. This is a Python 2.7 branch.

The "python3" branch is new (June, 2019). It has been tested with Python 3.6 through 3.7.9. Please read the notes on that branch for information on differences and new functionality. This is now the default branch.

Changes
=======
8 January 2020

Added notes to the installation regarding OSX Big Sur. If you are running cnmodel under Big Sur, you will need to use NEURON 7.8.2 (alpha), at least, and matplotlib > 3.3. These versions address changes necessary for cnmodel to function under Big Sur.

The current branch has been renamed the "main" branch. The "master" branch remains as it is linked from the literature.

10 October 2020

Clean up some of the requirements, installation via a shell script (Unix, Mac OSX). Posted a working installer (using a Windows batch file) under Windows 10.
Works with Python 3.7.9 and Neuron 7.8.1. No new features have been added.


01 May 2019, 04 June 2019

This version of cnmodel runs under  Python3.7, using Neuron 7.6-7.8.1. New features include a method for changing the data tables on the fly without editing the original tables, and a tool for fitting Exp2Syn "simple" PSCs to the multisite PSC data (or, potentially, to experimental data) to get parameters for the synapse description table.

The code base has been modified for Python 3. Functionally, the main internal change is that the parameters for the cells are (almost) completely removed to the data tables. All tests currently pass, but in a few cases are very close but not identical to the original Python 2.7 version (aka branch "master-Python27"). The source of one set of discrepancies has been traced to an error in a .mod file (a variable was declared in both the RANGE and GLOBAL lists).



About CNModel
=============

CNModel is a Python-based interface to NEURON models of cochlear nucleus neurons, synapses, network connectivity. To drive the model with sound stimuli, the Zilany et al (2010, 2014) auditory periphery model is used to generate auditory nerve spike trains (either via the "cochlea" Python package or by the original MATLAB model; see below). The overall goal is to provide a platform for modeling networks of cochlear nucleus neurons with different levels of biological realism in the context of an accurate simulation of auditory nerve input.

At the lowest level are NEURON-based implementations of ion channels and synapses. Ion channel models for potassium channels are derived largely from the measurements and models of Rothman and Manis (2003abc), and Kanold and Manis (1999, 2001); other channels are derived or modified from the literature. Cell models are in turn based on the insertion of ion channels in densities based on measurements in guinea pig and mouse. The "point" somatic cell models, which form the base set of models in CNModel, replicate the data reported in the original papers. 

The postsynaptic receptor/conductance models are based on kinetic models of glutamate (Raman and Trussell, 1992) and glycinergic receptors, as adjusted to match measurements of synaptic conductances from the mouse cochlear nucleus collected in Xie and Manis, 2013. The glutamate receptor models include desensitization and the effects of internal polyamine receptor block, based on the kinetic scheme of Woodhull (1982).

The presynaptic release model includes a multisite, probabilistic synapse that includes time-dependent changes in release probability based on the Dittman, Kreitzer and Regehr (J Neurosci. 2000 Feb 15;20(4):1374-85) kinetic scheme. Although detailed, this model is computationally expensive and likely not suitable for large scale network simulations. Other simpler models of synapses are also included.

Network connectivity may be defined programmatically, or based on a table of connectivity patterns. A table with estimates derived from the literature is included in the source. 

Included in this package is a set of test suites for different components. An overriding set of unit tests is available to confirm performance of the base models against a set of reference runs, several of which are in turn directly traceable to the original manuscripts. The test suites are useful in verifying performance of the model after modifications of the code or changes in the installation (upgrades of Python or Matlab, for example).

Installation requirements
-------------------------
Please see the file INSTALL.md for detailed installation requirements for both Windows and Mac OSX or Unix.



Testing
-------

Make sure you are in the cnmodel directory, and that you have selected the right environment in Anaconda or have activated the virtual environment for a pip install.

After the code is installed, enter the cnmodel directory and compile the NEURON mod (you might have already done this if you are following the instructions above)::

    $ nrnivmodl cnmodel/mechanisms

This will create a directory ("x86_64" or "special") in the top cnmodel directory with the compiled mechanisms.

Then::

    $ python examples/toy_model.py
     
should generate a plot with several sets of traces showing responses of individual neuron models to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current steps.

The test suite should then be run as::

    $ python test.py

This will test each of the models against reference data, the synapse mechanisms, a number of internal routines, and the auditory nerve model. The tests should pass for each component. Failures may indicate incorrect installation or incorrect function within individual components. These should be corrected before proceeding with simulations.

Individual test suite components can be run directly using pytest, for example::

    $  pytest cnmodel/cells/tests/test_cells.py -k "test_bushy_mouse"


Usage
-----
CNModel is meant to be used as an imported package under Python. See the files in the examples directory to see how this is done. Typically, we create a separate directory (a "simulation" directory) that holds the code that uses cnmodel for simulations, at the same level as cnmodel or elsewhere (do not place the simulation directory inside cnmodel).

The data tables in the cnmodel/data directory (synapses, ionchannels, populations, connectivity) should not be modified. If it is desired to change the parameters specified in these tables, it is best to copy them into the "simulation" directory in a separate path, and modify them there. The data tables can then be used as follows::

        from cnmodel import data
        import data_XM13nacncoop as CHAN  # where data_XM13nacncoop.py is a modified table in the simulation directory
        # The following takes the table named "XM13nacncoop_channels" from the CHAN table,
        # and overwrites the original table "XM13nacncoop_channels" that is in ionchannels.py. The original file in cnmodel is
        # not modified, only the data in memory. 
        changes = data.add_table_data('XM13nacncoop_channels', row_key='field', col_key='model_type',
                       species='mouse', data=CHAN.ChannelData)
        # The following takes the table indicating how the channel compartments should be decorated from the ChannelComparments
        # table, overwriting the original named table in ionchannels.py
        changes_c = data.add_table_data('XM13nacncoop_channels_compartments', row_key='parameter', col_key='compartment',
                species='mouse', model_type='II', data=CHAN.ChannelCompartments)
        # now print out what was changed!
        data.report_changes(changes)
        data.report_changes(changes_c)

That is all that it takes. Note the following: 

1. There are some limitations as to which parameters can be changed. as some paramaters, such as rate constants for the receptors and ion channels, are specified in the .mod files and are not exposed externally. 

2. The connectivity data table can be modified to represent a particular pattern of connectivity, and the populations data table can be modified to change the relative numbers of cells.
        
3. The data tables are very strict about column alignment. The first character of the column title and the each of the values in that column must line up directly. It is best/easiest to edit these tables in a programming editor with fixed width fonts and the ability to perform column-based insertions. Changes to the data tables should be annotated appropriately.

4. Channels and receptors are all specified as NEURON .mod files. Adding new mechanisms to a cell will require modification of the code to recognize the mechanisms at several points. It is especially to handle this in cnmodel/cells.py, where knowledge of channel names is needed to compute initial states; in the cell code itself where the channels are actually inserted, and in the relevant data tables. Specific naming conventions should be followed to simplify integration. Contact the authors for help.

Adding new cell types
---------------------

To add a new cell type, it is necessary to:
    
1. Create a source file in cnmodel/cells, likely based on the bushy.py source, renaming variables as necessary. The main routines in the class however, should maintain their present names and calling parameters.
    
1. Add the values for the cells to the data tables (all tables will need to be updated with new columns for the cell type).

1. Run the model and make sure the new cell type is performing as desired. Target parameters should be identified and verified against the model.

1.  Update the unit tests to include the new cell type.





MATLAB (R)
----------

This version has been tested with the MATLAB AN model of Zilany et al., 2014. 
Before using, you will need to compile the C code in an_model using Matlab's mex tool. First however, it *may* be necessary to change the following code:

In model_Synapse.c (cnmodel/an_model/model):

Change (line 63 in the source)::

	$ int    nrep, pxbins, lp,  outsize[2], totalstim;

to::

	$ int    nrep, pxbins, lp,  totalstim;
    $ size_t outsize[2];
    
Likewise, in model_IHC.c, change::

	$ int    nrep, pxbins, lp,  outsize[2], totalstim, species;

to::

	$ int    nrep, pxbins, lp,  totalstim, species;
    $ size_t outsize[2];

Then, in Matlab, go to the cnmodel/an_model/model directory, and run::

    $ mexANmodel

Then, cd to an_model and run::
    
    $ testANmodel    
    
to confirm that the model is installed and working.
(You may need to add the model directory to the Matlab path.)


Figures
-------

The data for most of the figures in the manuscript (Manis and Campagnola, Hearing Research 2018) can be generated using the bash script "figures.sh" in the examples subdirectory. 
From the main cnmodel directory::

    $ ./examples figures.sh fignum

where fignum is one of 2a, 2b, 2c, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b, or 7.

Note that Figure 7 may take several **hours** to generate.

Example code and tests

Potential Issues and Solutions
------------------------------

1.  Occasionally one of the AN spike train files, which are stored in the directory `cnmodel/an_model/cache`, become locked. This can occur if the calling routines (e.g., simulation runs) are aborted (^C, ^Z) in the middle of a transaction accessing the cache file, or perhaps during when parallel processing is enabled and a routine fails or is aborted. In this case, a file with the extension ``".lock"`` exists, which prevents the an_model code from accessing the file. The ``".lock"`` file needs to be deleted from the cache directory. Because the cache directory contains an hierarchical arrangement of subdirectories, and can be populated with thousands of files after a few runs requiring many auditory nerve datasets, finding the lock file can be somewhat tedious. The following should help under Unix:
    
  *  First, print a list of the locked files::
      
          - find /path/to/cache -name '*.lock'
    
  * Where /path/to/cache may be something like `cnmodel/an_model/cache`. 
    There is most likely only one such file in the diretory.

  * Next, to delete the files::
  
      - find /path/to/cache -name '*.lock' -delete
       
  * Under Windows (and other OS's), you should be able do accomplish the same thing
    with the File Explorer/Finder, limiting the files by extension.
    
  * An alternative (for any OS) is to take advantage of Python's pathlib module. The glob search is 
    remarkably fast (on my system, it takes under a minute to search through more than 3.5 million
    cached AN spike trains)::
    
            >>python
            > from pathlib import Path
            > gl = Path('.').rglob('*.lock')
            > locks = list(gl) # (could do this in the next line)
            > # print(locks)  # see the lock files
            > for g in locks:  # now remove the lock files
            >    g.unlink()
            >
